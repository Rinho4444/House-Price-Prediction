# House Price Prediction Report

## Abstract
This project aims to accurately predict house prices using Machine Learning. We utilize **AutoML, LightGBM, and Optuna** for model optimization. Our approach improves on baseline models, achieving a lower RMSE and better generalization.

## Introduction
Actually, this project is improved from the assignment that our team has to complete in the class AI4B. However, my team realizes that predicting house prices is a crucial task in the real world. In estate industry, accurate predictions help buyers and sellers make informed decisions. Therefore, this project aims to develop a predictive model using advanced machine learning techniques to estimate house prices, not only to finish the class's assignment but to solve real-world problem.

## Dataset & Data Processing
- **Raw data**: The data set that we used was taken from Kaggle in [King County, USA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)
