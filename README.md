# House Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project

Welcome to our **House Price Prediction** project! This repository contains an advanced Machine Learning model trained to predict house prices based on real-world datasets from Kaggle. We leverage **AutoGluon, LightGBM, and Optuna** to optimize performance and achieve high accuracy.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project was initially developed as an assignment for the AI4B class, where we were tasked with building a predictive model for house prices. While fulfilling the course requirements, our team recognized the broader significance of this problem in the real estate industry. Accurate price predictions can aid buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions, optimizing market strategies, and assessing property values more effectively.
