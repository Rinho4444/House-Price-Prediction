# House Price Prediction Report

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Abstract
This project aims to accurately predict house prices using Machine Learning. We utilize **AutoML, LightGBM, and Optuna** for model optimization. Our approach improves on baseline models, achieving a lower RMSE and better generalization.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction
This project was initially developed as an assignment for the AI4B class, where we were tasked with building a predictive model for house prices. While fulfilling the course requirements, our team recognized the broader significance of this problem in the real estate industry. Accurate price predictions can aid buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions, optimizing market strategies, and assessing property values more effectively.

To ensure our model has practical applications beyond the classroom, we extend this project with advanced machine learning techniques, such as **LightGBM**, **Optuna**, and **AutoML**, to enhance prediction accuracy. This approach allows us to both meet the academic expectations of our coursework and contribute meaningfully to real-world applications of AI in real estate. 

To create the best project, the team members were encouraged to optimise their teamwork and communication to help each other. The tasks were divided as follow:
- Exploring/understanding the data: Le Xuan Trong
- Data cleaning and : Pham Ha Khanh Chi
- Building the models: Le Ky Nam
- Optimising the models: Pham Dang Hung
- Writing the report: Pham Ha Khanh Chi

Each task was completed successfully by not just the assigned member but also by the help of the whole team during the process.
The AIM for this project was for us to successfully build a model by the information given, applying all the knowledge we had been taught in AI4B class. Plus, we also learned teamwork and communication skills to be able to solve any bugs, obstacles or, problems passing by during the process.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Analysis

### Data:
- **Raw data**: The data set that we used was [House Sales in King County, USA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction) from Kaggle. But, our teachers had already split the data set into three: X_train, y_train and X_test, in which X_train and y_train were used to train the model, and X_test would be used as the data set to produce the predicted house sales for scoring and ranking teams in AI4B class.
-  **Processed Data**: Cleaned and feature-engineered dataset ready for model training.

### üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To understand our dataset better and prepare it for modeling, we conducted several visual analyses:

#### **Histogram Analysis**
- **Purpose:** Check the distribution of key variables to determine if transformations are needed.
- **Example:**
  - House price distribution:
    ![Price Distribution](images/price_distribution.png)
    - If the price is heavily skewed, applying log transformation may help stabilize variance.
  - Living area distribution:
    ![Living Area Distribution](images/living_area_distribution.png)
    - Helps check if we need to normalize or scale features for better model performance.

#### **Heatmap (Correlation Matrix)**
- **Purpose:** Identify relationships between variables and remove redundant features.
- **Example:**
  ![Heatmap Correlation](images/heatmap_correlation.png)
  - If two features have high correlation (e.g., living area and number of rooms), we may drop one to avoid multicollinearity.

#### **Bar Chart Analysis**
- **Purpose:** Check data balance across categorical features.
- **Example:**
  - House count by condition:
    ![Condition Distribution](images/condition_distribution.png)
    - If most houses have a similar condition, this feature may not contribute much to predictions.
  - House count by built year:
    ![Built Year Distribution](images/built_year_distribution.png)
    - If some years have very few houses, we might group them into bins to improve learning stability.

#### **Box Plot Analysis**
- **Purpose:** Detect outliers and understand the spread of continuous variables.
- **Example:**
  - House price by year built:
    ![Price vs Built Year](images/price_vs_built_year.png)
    - If there are extreme outliers, we may consider capping or removing them.

#### **Scatter Plot Analysis**
- **Purpose:** Examine relationships between numerical features and house prices.
- **Example:**
  - Price vs. living area:
    ![Price vs Living Area](images/price_vs_living_area.png)
    - If the relationship is nonlinear, we might try feature engineering (e.g., log transformation).
  - Price vs. number of bedrooms:
    ![Price vs Bedrooms](images/price_vs_bedrooms.png)
    - If a weak correlation is observed, we may reconsider using this feature.


## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Methodology
### üî¨ Model Selection
- **Baseline Model**: The best model choosing between K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- **Optimized Model**: The best model choosing from **AutoGluon** (LightGBM) with hyperparameter tuning using **Optuna**.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Discussion
### ü§î Challenges Faced
- Presence of outliers affecting results.
- Some features had skewed distributions, impacting data normalization.

### üöÄ Improvements
- Experimenting with models like XGBoost, CatBoost.
- Collecting additional data to improve generalization.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion
The LightGBM model, combined with Optuna, successfully optimized performance, achieving higher accuracy than traditional models. This project can be expanded by collecting more data or applying deep learning techniques.
