# House Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project

Welcome to our **House Price Prediction** project! This repository contains an advanced Machine Learning model trained to predict house prices based on real-world datasets from Kaggle. We leverage **AutoGluon, LightGBM, and Optuna** to optimize performance and achieve high accuracy.

## Project Overview
This project was initially developed as an assignment for the AI4B class, where we were tasked with building a predictive model for house prices. While fulfilling the course requirements, our team recognized the broader significance of this problem in the real estate industry. Accurate price predictions can aid buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions, optimizing market strategies, and assessing property values more effectively.    

The AIM for this project was for us to successfully build a model by the information given, applying all the knowledge we had been taught in AI4B class. Plus, we also learned teamwork and communication skills to be able to solve any bugs, obstacles or, problems passing by during the process.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - House Sales in King County, USA Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)
- **Features:** 21 attributes related to house characteristics (size, location, quality, etc.).
- **Target Variable:** Sale price of houses.

## Results
Our optimized LightGBM model achieved **an RMSE of 169731 on the test set**, demonstrating strong predictive capabilities.

## Future Improvements
🔹 Implement more advanced feature selection techniques.  
🔹 Explore deep learning models (e.g., ANN, Transformer-based).  
🔹 Deploy the model as a web service using FastAPI or Flask.
